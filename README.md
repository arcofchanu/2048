## ðŸ§  Key Components Breakdown

-   **`App.tsx`**: The root component that manages the overall game state (start screen vs. active game) and assembles the UI.
-   **`hooks/useGame.ts`**: The heart of the game's interactivity. This custom hook manages the game board, score, user input (keyboard and touch), and game state transitions.
-   **`lib/gameLogic.ts`**: A set of pure functions that handle the core rules of 2048: initializing the board, processing moves, merging tiles, adding new random tiles, and checking for the game-over condition.
-   **`components/Board.tsx`**: Renders the game grid and positions the tiles based on the state provided by the `useGame` hook. It uses CSS variables to dynamically calculate tile sizes and positions.
-   **`components/Tile.tsx`**: A memoized component that represents a single tile. It handles its own styling based on its value and its spawn/merge animations.
-   **`components/LiveBackground.tsx`**: Creates the immersive, falling character animation using the HTML Canvas API.
-   **`components/InteractiveStartObject.tsx`**: Integrates a Babylon.js scene to render the interactive 3D orb on the start screen.
-   **`components/ScoreMilestoneEffect.tsx`**: Manages the detailed shockwave animation that provides visual feedback when the player reaches a score milestone.
